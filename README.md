Introduction

Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process that empowers citizens to vote on the allocation of public funds within their communities, such as municipalities, towns, or neighborhoods (Pięta-Szawara, 2019; Cabannes, 2004). Unlike traditional representative democracy, PB invites citizens to engage directly in budgetary decision-making, reducing clientelism and corruption while fostering inclusivity, especially for marginalized and historically underrepresented groups (Sintomer et al., 2008). This system originated in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1989, and has since spread widely across Latin America, North America, and Europe. For instance, in Poland, cities like Warsaw and Wrocław have embraced PB, allocating millions of euros and engaging hundreds of thousands of voters annually (Kozłowski & Bernaciak, 2021).
The aggregation of individual preferences is a central topic within computational social choice. In participatory budgeting, an instance where voters indicate how much budget each alternative should receive is known as divisible PB or the budget proposal aggregation problem. This problem type allows voters to express varying levels of support across multiple options, rather than selecting a single or multiple discrete winners, leading to a more granular reflection of community preferences. Beyond PB, budget proposal aggregation is also applicable in contexts such as scheduling time across conference activities or allocating funds among school programs and clubs.
